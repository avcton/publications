Dimensional Modeling Concepts:
1- Dimensional Modeling Basics
2- Star Schema vs Snowflake Schema vs Hybrid
3- Factless fact table
4- Multi-fact Star schema (Families of Stars) 
5- Shared dimensions and Conforming dimensions
6- Multi Star Schema and Degenerated dimensions
7- Slowly changing diemnsions and type1/type2/type3 changes
8- Surrogate Key or Artificial Key
9- Rapidly changing (large) dimensions
10- Junk dimension
11- Additivity of measures: Fully/Semi/Non Additive
12- Aggregate fact tables
13- Snapshot and Transaction fact tables
14- Core and Custom fact tables
